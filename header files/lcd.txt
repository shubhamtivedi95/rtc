void lcd_Decimal_display(unsigned int value)
	This function is used to display any decimal variable on display.


void lcd_BCD_display(unsigned int value)
	This function is used to display any BCD variable on display.
	This function is mostly used in ds1307 rtc.


void lcd_init(unsigned char bits)
	This function is used to initalise display. 
	User will have to pass a value to initialise lcd in either 4 bit mode or 8 bit mode.
	for initialise in 4 bit user should pass 4 in this function and for 8 bit mode 8.
	This function clears the display, switch on the display, set curser at beginning of first row.
	Ex: lcd_init(4); 

void lcd_msg_display(unsigned char text[])
	This function is used to display fixed message string on lcd.

	user will have to pass row and coloum value to this function.


void lcd_shift_left(unsigned char time,unsigned int duration)
	This function is used to shift entire display to left.
	user should define how much time it will shift to and the durtion between two shift.
	Ex: lcd_shift_left(5,500);
	This will shift the display to the left 5 time and each shift occurs after 500 miliseconds.


void lcd_shift_right(unsigned char time,unsigned int duration)
	This function is used to shift entire display to right.
	user should define how much time it will shift to and the durtion between two shift.
	Ex: lcd_shift_right(5,500);
